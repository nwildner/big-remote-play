## 📖 The Story Behind the Project

Big Remote Play was born from a **real story** of friendship, determination, and the passion for Free Software.

**Alessandro e Silva Xavier** (known as **Alessandro**) and **Alexasandro Pacheco Feliciano** (known as **Pacheco**) wanted to play games together on [BigLinux](https://www.biglinux.com.br) using a feature that only existed on proprietary platforms like **Steam Remote Play** and **GeForce NOW**. The problem? These systems are **proprietary**, locked to their own ecosystems. If a game wasn't available on their platform, it was nearly impossible to play remotely with friends.

Refusing to accept this limitation, Alessandro and Pacheco embarked on a journey of countless attempts and extensive research. After trying many different approaches, they finally found a working solution by **combining multiple free software programs** — including [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine), [Moonlight](https://moonlight-stream.org/), scripts, and VPN tools. They had achieved what the proprietary platforms kept locked behind their walls, and the best part: it was **Free Software** and **multi-platform**!

Excited by their success, they started sharing their achievement during their **live streams**, which generated tremendous enthusiasm from the community. However, there was a catch — the setup was complicated. It required configuring multiple separate solutions: Sunshine, Moonlight, custom scripts, VPN connections... it was a lot for anyone to handle.

That's when a friend decided to step in and help develop a unified application to simplify the entire process. And so, **Big Remote Play** was born! 🎉

An all-in-one application that integrates everything you need for remote cooperative gaming — no proprietary platforms, no restrictions, no limits on which games you can play.

## 🔧 How It Works

Big Remote Play acts as a **unified interface** that orchestrates multiple open-source technologies:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│            Big Remote Play (GTK4)           │
├──────────────┬──────────────┬────────────────────────┤
│  Host View   │  Guest View  │  Private Network View  │
├──────────────┴──────────────┴────────────────────────┤
│                   Core Services                       │
├──────────────┬──────────────┬────────────────────────┤
│  ☀️ Sunshine  │  🌙 Moonlight │  🔒 Headscale/Tailscale/ZeroTier│
│  (Host)      │  (Client)    │  (VPN)                        │
└──────────────┴──────────────┴────────────────────────┘
```

### Quick Start Guide

#### As a Host (Sharing games):
1. Open **Big Remote Play**
2. Navigate to **Host Server**
3. Configure your streaming settings (resolution, FPS, codec)
4. Select which games to share
5. Click **Start Server**
6. Share your PIN or IP with your friends!

#### As a Guest (Connecting to play):
1. Open **Big Remote Play**
2. Navigate to **Connect to Server**
3. Either:
   - Select a **discovered host** from the list
   - Enter the host's **IP address** manually
   - Use a **PIN code** for quick connection
4. Pair with the host and start playing!

#### Over the Internet:
1. Set up a **Private Network** using the built-in wizard
2. Share the connection credentials with your friend
3. Both connect to the private network
4. Connect as Host/Guest as usual — the VPN handles the rest!
